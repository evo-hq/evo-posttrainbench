# AGENTS.md

Guidelines for AI agents working on the PostTrainBench codebase.

## Project Overview

PostTrainBench is a benchmark framework that measures AI agents' ability to perform **LLM post-training** - improving pre-trained small language models on specific benchmarks through automated research. Agents are typically given 10 hours on an H100 GPU to improve base models, with performance measured by benchmark scores.

## Adding a New Agent

1. Create directory: `agents/<agent_name>/`
2. Create entry point: `agents/<agent_name>/solve.sh`
3. The `solve.sh` script receives the system prompt via the `$PROMPT` environment variable
   (also some agents take it as a CLI arg). It runs inside the apptainer sandbox with `/home/ben/task`
   as the working directory and should produce `final_model/` there when finished.
4. Add an agent-specific submission template if needed: `src/commit_utils/single_task_<agent>.sub`
5. Per-agent parsing: add a parser in `src/trace_parsing/<agent>_parser.py` and register it in
   `parse_trace.py` so `solve_parsed.txt` is human-readable.
6. If the agent needs persistent OAuth state (e.g. `codex_non_api`), drop an `auth.json` or
   `oauth_token` next to `solve.sh`; `run_task.sh` bind-mounts them into the sandbox.

Example structure:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# agents/myagent/solve.sh
myagent-cli --model "$AGENT_CONFIG" "$PROMPT"
```

Currently supported agents include: `claude`, `claude_non_api`, `claude_non_api_max`, `codex`,
`codex_non_api` (and `_high`, `_xhigh`, `_reprompt`, ...), `codexhigh`, `codexlow`, `gemini`,
`glm5`, `opencode`, `qwen3max`.

## Adding a New Evaluation Task

1. Create directory: `src/eval/tasks/<task_name>/`
2. Required files:
   - `evaluate.py` - Evaluation script using Inspect AI framework
   - `benchmark.txt` - Official benchmark name (single line)
   - `info.json` - Benchmark metadata used by judges/prompt generation
   - `test_data.json` - Test items used both to compute scores and by the contamination judge
3. Optional files:
   - `evaluation_code/` - Supporting evaluation code copied into the agent sandbox
   - `task_context/` - Additional context (e.g. dataset hints) copied into the agent sandbox

The `evaluate.py` must:
- Use `inspect_ai` framework
- Accept `--model-path` for the model directory and `--templates-dir` for chat templates
- Write metrics to the path given by `--json-output-file` (consumed by aggregation scripts)

## Running Jobs

```bash
# Submit the full agent × benchmark × model sweep (edit the loop / EXPERIMENT_NAME at the top)
bash src/commit_utils/commit.sh

# Submit a single task
condor_submit_bid 100 \
    -a "agent=codex" \
    -a "agent_config=gpt-5.1-codex-max" \
    -a "eval=gsm8k" \
    -a "model_to_train=Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base" \
    -a "num_hours=10" \
    src/commit_utils/single_task.sub
```

`single_task.sub` accepts extra `-a` overrides such as `num_gpus`, `request_memory`,
`request_cpus`, and `experiment_name` (which becomes the `_run*` suffix on the result dir).

## Important Conventions

- **Bash for orchestration**: All entry points and job scripts are bash
- **Python for evaluation**: Use Inspect AI framework for benchmark evaluation
- **Jinja2 for templates**: Chat templates in `src/eval/templates/`
- **HTCondor for scheduling**: Job submission via `.sub` files
- **Apptainer for containers**: Container definitions in `.def` files; built `.sif` files live in
  `$POST_TRAIN_BENCH_CONTAINERS_DIR`
- **Sandbox layout**: Inside the container, the home is `/home/ben` and the working dir is
  `/home/ben/task`. The agent must place its trained checkpoint at `task/final_model/`.

## Safety Mechanisms

The project includes contamination detection via two agent-as-judge runs invoked by
`src/run_task.sh` after the agent finishes (also exposed standalone via
`src/disallowed_usage_judge/run_judge.sh`):

1. **GPT-5.4 contamination judge** (codex CLI, subscription auth) — checks for test-data usage,
   eval tampering, model substitution, and forbidden fine-tuning practices.
2. **GPT-5.4 third-party API usage judge** (codex CLI) — separate schema (`disallowed_api_usage`),
   checks whether the agent called external LLM APIs in a disallowed way. Its result is folded
   into `judge_result.json` but the per-judge file uses its own keys.

Reruns: `src/disallowed_usage_judge/rerun_judge/` holds the batch-rerun pipeline. Rerun outputs
always carry a `_rerun` suffix so original judge files produced during `run_task.sh` are
preserved.

The judge tooling itself lives in:
- `src/disallowed_usage_judge/judge_tools/` — `contamination_check.py`,
  `model_identity_check.py`, and `reference_configs/` (copied into the judge sandbox so the
  judge can run them as tools)
- `src/disallowed_usage_judge/contamination_check_tool/` — helpers to (re)download test data

## Results Structure

```
results/{agent}_{agent_config}_{num_hours}h[_{num_gpus}gpu]{experiment_name}/
└── {benchmark}_{model_name}_{cluster_id}/
    ├── output.log               # run_task.sh stdout
    ├── error.log                # run_task.sh stderr

    └── metrics.json                     # Final benchmark scores
```

Result directories with the `_rerun` suffix on `judgement_*.json` / `judge_result.json` come
from the rerun-judge pipeline; original files are kept side-by-side.

## Code Style

- Shell scripts: Use bash, include `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Python: Standard library preferred, use type hints
- Error handling: Fail explicitly - do not silently handle errors

## Environment variables

Use the environment variables which are currently set in *this* environment.
E.g. when wanting to explore the results folder, use `$POST_TRAIN_BENCH_RESULTS_DIR` if it is set.

Common ones (sourced from `.env` via `src/commit_utils/set_env_vars.sh`):
- `POST_TRAIN_BENCH_RESULTS_DIR` — where per-run result directories are written
- `POST_TRAIN_BENCH_CONTAINERS_DIR` — where built `.sif` containers live
- `POST_TRAIN_BENCH_CONTAINER_NAME` — default container for the agent sandbox
- `POST_TRAIN_BENCH_EXPERIMENT_NAME` — suffix added to the result directory name
- `POST_TRAIN_BENCH_JOB_SCHEDULER` — controls which scheduler branch in `commit.sh` runs
- `HF_HOME` — host-side Hugging Face cache that gets overlay-mounted into the sandbox

## Co-Authorship

Never add yourself as a co-author to commits.

## Testing

Usually when testing, it is best to use the openai model `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, because we have a
lot of api credits for openai.

## Notes

Add your own notes to the directory `/home/brank/Documents/agents_notes` and index them via
`/home/brank/Documents/agents_notes/index.md`. Add those notes for other agents and for yourself
for future use.
