"""Aggregate per-judge judgement.json files into a single judge_result.json.

All judges are passed as repeatable `--judge NAME=PATH`. The judge with the
reserved name `api` is interpreted as the third-party API usage judge and must
contain:
  - disallowed_api_usage (bool)
  - justification_disallowed_api_usage (string)

Every other judge is interpreted as a contamination/base-model judge and must
contain:
  - contamination (bool)
  - disallowed_model (bool)
  - justification_contamination (string)
  - justification_disallowed_model (string)

At least one contamination judge and exactly one `api` judge must be supplied.

The aggregated output schema:
  - contamination: True if ANY contamination judge flagged it
  - disallowed_model: True if ANY contamination judge flagged it
  - disallowed_api_usage: verbatim from the API judge
  - justification_contamination / justification_disallowed_model: per-judge
    justifications concatenated with a `[judge_name]` tag
  - justification_disallowed_api_usage: verbatim from the API judge

If any supplied per-judge file is missing, unparseable, or missing required
fields, this script fails loudly (non-zero exit, no output written) so that
callers don't end up with a False/False default that masks a crashed judge.

Usage:
    aggregate_judgement.py --output judge_result.json \
        --judge gpt5_4=judgement_gpt5_4.json \
        --judge kimi=judgement_kimi.json \
        --judge api=judgement_api.json
